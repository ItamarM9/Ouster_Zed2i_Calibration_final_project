# üé• Recording the Calibration Set

To achieve accurate LiDAR‚ÄìCamera calibration, it's essential to capture high-quality, synchronized recordings from both sensors with the calibration target (typically a chessboard) clearly visible. Follow these steps:

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Power on and verify** both the LiDAR and camera sensors are functioning properly.
2. **Start both the LiDAR and camera recordings** simultaneously.
3. **Hold the calibration chessboard firmly** so that it's fully visible to both sensors. The board should face the camera but be angled slightly to provide depth variation for the LiDAR.
4. **Move slowly and deliberately** through the following motions:
   - Side-to-side (left ‚Üî right).
   - Forward and backward (toward and away from the sensors).
   - Tilt and rotate the board at various angles to capture a wide variety of poses and orientations.
5. **Stop both the LiDAR and camera recordings** when finished. Ensure that all output files are saved correctly (images, `.bin` files, and timestamp logs).

### üìå Tips for Best Results:

- **Avoid occlusions**: Make sure your body or hands don‚Äôt block any part of the chessboard from either sensor. Keep the board fully within the camera frame and the LiDAR‚Äôs field of view throughout.
- **Vary the distance** from close range (~1 meter) to farther ranges (~5 meters) to improve calibration robustness.
- Aim to record at least **30‚Äì50 usable frames** with clear chessboard visibility and LiDAR coverage. You will record more frames ‚Äî the subset creation script will filter the best matches afterward.
- Ensure your **chessboard is flat and non-reflective** ‚Äî glossy or warped boards can introduce noise in both image and LiDAR data.
- **Avoid fast movements** ‚Äî sudden motion can cause blur or misalignment, reducing calibration accuracy.



# LiDAR‚ÄìCamera Calibration Scripts

This folder contains scripts for: creating a subset of synchronized LiDAR‚ÄìCamera pairs, calibration - finding the intrinsic and extrinsics, visualizing lidar ROIs, and projecting LiDAR points onto camera images with your chosen ROI.

## üìÑ What Each Script Does

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `calibration_subset_auto_creation.py`
- **Purpose:** 
  - Finds matching LiDAR and camera frames based on timestamps.
  - Optionally applies chessboard detection to filter pairs.
  - Copies matching pairs into a clean `images/` and `lidar/` subset.
- **Before you run:**
  - ‚úÖ Update the paths in the **CONFIGURATION** section:
    - `IMAGE_DIR`, `LIDAR_DIR` ‚Äî your raw data folders.
    - `CAMERA_TS_FILE`, `LIDAR_TS_FILE` ‚Äî timestamp text files.
    - `OUTPUT_DIR` ‚Äî where to write the subset.
  - ‚úÖ Adjust `CAMERA_OFFSET` and `THRESHOLD` if needed. We saw than as of 01/07/25 the camera's timestemps are early by ~0.9 second relative to the ouster.
  - ‚úÖ If using chessboard filtering (`FILTER_CORNERS=True`):
    - **Verify `PATTERN_SIZE`** matches your actual chessboard (e.g., `(8, 6)` means 8 inner corners wide by 6 high).

- **Note:**  
  Even if you want to test your calibration on an environment **without the chessboard**, you still need to run this script to create a properly **time-synchronized subset** of matching LiDAR and image pairs.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `calibration_lidar_camera.py`
- **Purpose:**
  - Detects chessboard corners in camera images.
  - Calibrates camera intrinsics.
  - Extracts LiDAR planes.
  - Estimates the LiDAR‚ÜíCamera transformation.
  - Projects LiDAR points onto images for validation.
- **Before you run:**
  - ‚úÖ Update `image_dir` and `bin_dir` to point to your **subset** folders.
  - ‚úÖ Verify the `roi` (region of interest) is suitable for your LiDAR range.
  - ‚úÖ Make sure your chessboard configuration is correct:
    - **Check `pattern_size`** (number of inner corners).
    - **Check `square_size`** (length of one square in meters).

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `inspect_lidar_roi.py`
- **Purpose:**
  - Loads a LiDAR `.bin` file and shows it in Open3D.
  - Lets you check your region of interest visually.
- **Before you run:**
  - ‚úÖ Update `bin_path` to the LiDAR file you want to inspect.
  - ‚úÖ Adjust `roi` if needed.
  - ‚úÖ Set `crop=True` if you want to see only the cropped points.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ `project_with_different_roi.py`
- **Purpose:**
  - Uses your saved calibration (`calibration_data.npz`).
  - Re-projects LiDAR points onto images with a **ROI of your choise**.
  - Saves new overlay images for validation or visualization.
- **Before you run:**
  - ‚úÖ Update `calib_file` path to your saved `.npz` calibration file.
  - ‚úÖ Set `image_dir` and `bin_dir` to the pairs you want to project.
  - ‚úÖ Adjust `new_roi` to your new region of interest.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What You Must Always Do

‚úÖ **Always update file paths** to match your Ubuntu or Windows machine. 
‚úÖ Make sure your input files exist before you run a script.  
‚úÖ Double-check that `pattern_size` and `square_size` match your physical chessboard when relevant.  
‚úÖ Outputs are written to folders defined in each script ‚Äî check these after you run.

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è That‚Äôs It!

Run each script from PyCharm or a terminal, in the order you need for your workflow.  
No extra setup ‚Äî just fix your paths and go.

**Good luck with your calibration!** üöó‚ú®
